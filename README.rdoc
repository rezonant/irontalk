= Irontalk -- A pragmatic Smalltalk implementation on top of the Common Language Runtime.

Irontalk is an attempt to create a complete implementation of the Smalltalk programming language for the Common Language Runtime (AKA the .NET Framework).

== Usage

Currently Irontalk is in a testing stage. A simple command-line tool is included to evaluate Smalltalk expressions using the Irontalk engine. Though Irontalk
is intended to become a full Smalltalk interpreter, compiler, and runtime, only the interpreter and runtime facilities are currently in place.

== Developers

Irontalk is being developed using Monodevelop 2.4, Mono 2.6, and NUnit, but the development infrastructure should work equally as well using Visual Studio 
and Microsoft .NET. We invite all interested developers to check out the repository and load it up in the IDE of their choice. The build infrastructure is 
MSBuild/XBuild and I have no intention of changing that, so please don't ask to change to Makefiles or CMake or NAnt or any such nonsense, as the proper 
open source tools are (and have been) available to compile the code without requiring Visual Studio.
